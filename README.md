# Welcome to KeepTrack-CLI!
The command line todo list for all your needs :)

## What is KeepTrack-CLI?
KeepTrack-CLI started as a small project idea I was gonna use to practice Rust. However, I figured I would make this feature complete and release it so people can use and enjoy it!
Hopefully it helps someone out there keep track of their tasks.

## What are some features?
Some of the features of KeepTrack-CLI will be (The first three features are a given):
- listing you current todo list
- adding to the todo list
- removing tasks from the list
- filtering the list by task importance
- auto removal of completed tasks when exiting the program
- the creation of multiple lists
- and more!

## Current state of the project
There is finally a prerelease availible! This version is unstable, and bugs are most likely going to be present. If you encounter any bugs with the prerelease version, please don't hesitate to put an issue up! I'll respons as soon as I'm able to.

## Future plans for the project
Don't worry! This project will be maintained for the forseeable future. I plan on adding more features such as tags and favorites! I also want to incorporate a task id system, so tasks can be selected easier! As for the next update, I'm not so sure. I am a solo dev and am quite busy. However, I assure you I am working long and hard on this project!
