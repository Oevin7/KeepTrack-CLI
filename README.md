# Welcome to KeepTrack-CLI!
The command line todo list for all your needs :)

## What is KeepTrack-CLI?
KeepTrack-CLI started as a small project idea I was gonna use to practice Rust. However, I figured I would make this feature complete and release it so people can use and enjoy it!
Hopfully it helps someone out there keep track of their tasks.

## What are some features?
Some of the features of KeepTrack-CLI will be (The first three features are a given):
- listing you current todo list
- adding to the todo list
- removing tasks from the list
- filtering the list by task importance
- auto removal of completed tasks when exiting the program
- the creation of mutlitple lists
- and more!

## Current state of the project
Right now the project is still WIP. Not all the features are done, and I still have a lot of work to do before I will be ready to release the project. I will keep this page updated
and I will ensure there will be a feature rich, full release soon! I will also release a small page of documentation to help users install and get started!
