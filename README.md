# Welcome to KeepTrack-CLI!
The command line todo list for all your needs :)

## What is KeepTrack-CLI?
KeepTrack-CLI started as a small project idea I was gonna use to practice Rust. However, I figured I would make this feature complete and release it so people can use and enjoy it!
Hopfully it helps someone out there keep track of their tasks.

## What are some features?
Some of the features of KeepTrack-CLI will be (The first three features are a given):
- listing you current todo list
- adding to the todo list
- removing tasks from the list
- filtering the list by task importance
- auto removal of completed tasks when exiting the program
- the creation of mutlitple lists
- and more!

## Current state of the project
There is an update to the current state of the project! Most of the features are implemented! Infact I only have a few more I want to implement. I can't give an exact release date, but hopefully it will be sooner rather than later.
